## Flink Java examples

This folder contains examples of Flink applications written in Java

You can import all the Java examples in your IDE importing the parent `pom.xml` in this directory, 
and you can build all examples at once running `mvn package` in this directory.

Alternatively, you can import and build each single example independently.
